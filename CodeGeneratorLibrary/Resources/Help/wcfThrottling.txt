Throttling enables you to avoid your service and the underlying resources it allocates and uses.
This service behavior provides 3 settings

MaxConcurrentCalls     : Max number of messages actively processing across a ServiceHost
	- Default setting: 200

MaxConcurrentInstances : Max number of InstanceContext objects in the service that can execute at one time.
	- Default setting: 200

MaxConcurrentSessions  : Max number of sessions a ServiceHost object can accept at one time.
	- Default setting: 200

The use of ServiceThrottlingBehavior through an application configuration file is the most common 
method of modifying execution to maximize service performance.
