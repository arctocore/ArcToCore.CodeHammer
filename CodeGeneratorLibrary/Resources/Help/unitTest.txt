Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of 
code, sets of one or more program modules together with 
associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are 
tested to determine whether they are ready for use.

The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show 
that the individual parts are correct.
