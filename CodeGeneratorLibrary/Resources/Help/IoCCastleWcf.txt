Inversion of control is used to increase modularity of the program and make it extensible, and has
applications in object-oriented programming and other programming paradigms. The term was 
popularized by Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler. The term is related to but different 
from the dependency inversion principle, which concerns itself with decoupling dependencies 
between high-level and low-level layers through shared abstractions.
